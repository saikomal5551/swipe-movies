Swipe Movies is a movie discovery website designed for a seamless and engaging experience. Users can swipe through movies, watch trailers, and read short bios and reviews. The platform simplifies recommendations with categories like Go with Mood, Trending, and Genres. It uses the OMDB API for movie data, integrates comments on the movie details page, and is hosted on GitHub with Firebase as the backend. The goal is to provide a fun, interactive way to explore movies without overwhelming users with too many choices upfront.
